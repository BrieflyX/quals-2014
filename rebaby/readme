rebaby is a low value reversing challenge that requires reversing and optomizing an algorithm.  
The algorithm provided requires 10GB of disc and has 
lots of disc writes/seeks with io flush after
tons of printf followed by fflush
giant, irrelevant allocations,
required inputs
extraneous loops
the outputs is "the key is: $key" which is hashed and reconstructed from the file output algorithmically, 
but the algorithm can be simplified and resequenced to about 10 lines of c.
